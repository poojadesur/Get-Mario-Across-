Welcome to Mario and Yoshi! (scam baby version)

---------------------------------------------HOW TO PLAY------------------------------------------------

This is a two player game, one player always starts at the top, and the second player starts at the bottom. 
The top right corner of the screen shows whose turn it is.

Player1 plays with arrow keys: up, down, right, left
Player2 plays with keys: w, s, d, a (respectively)

There are three levels in each game (and so three rounds), with progressively faster speed of the moving obstacles.
(Level 1 has the slowest speed, Level 2 has faster moving obstacles and so on.)

Crossing a fixed obstacle wins you 5 points, and crossing moving obstacles wins you 10 points.

A player wins a round if they have a higher score in that round. If the scores were equal, whoever took lesser time wins the round.

If a player wins two out of three rounds, they win the game. 

The whole game restarts when a player has won the game, and the moving obstacles then reset to the lowest speed.
